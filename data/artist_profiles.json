Enjoy sophisticated song stylings as Ross pays musical tribute to some of America\u2019s greatest composers, including works by Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart, Jerome Kern, Oscar Hammerstein, and Stephen Sondheim, among many others. \n\nIn 1884 the American industrialist Henry Gurdon Marquand (1819\u20131902) commissioned noted British artist Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1836\u20131912) to design a Greco-Pompeiian music room for his new Madison Avenue mansion. It was an era when designing luxurious rooms in different styles\u2014Renaissance, Moorish, Japanese, French\u2014was popular among the affluent, and this trend was well represented in other mansions being built along the fashionable avenues in New York. Although Alma-Tadema was most famous as a painter of scenes set in antiquity, he was also known for the imaginative interiors of his own residences. The Marquand music room commission resulted in one of the most evocative interiors of late nineteenth-century New York, featuring a suite of elaborately inlaid furniture alongside textiles, paintings, sculptures, and ancient ceramics in a room that showed off Marquand\u2019s collections while serving as a center for social events and musical performances Orchestrating Elegance: Alma-Tadema and Design (June 4 \u2013 September 4, 2017) looks at the history of this exceptional moment in Alma-Tadema\u2019s career and reunites many of the extraordinary components of this lost room for the first time in more than a century.", "view_count": 2287, "channel_title": "ClarkArtInstitute", "channel_description": "The Clark is one of only a handful of institutions globally with a dual mission as an art museum and a distinguished center for research and higher education, dedicated to advancing and extending the public understanding of art.", "duration": {"duration": "2:43", "duration_in_seconds": 163}}, {"video_id": "dXBJmrHb-GY", "watch_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXBJmrHb-GY", "preview_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dXBJmrHb-GY", "title": "STEVE ROSS & KAREN OBERLIN in CHEEK TO CHEEK: Sneek Peek", "description": "Steve Ross & Karen Oberlin in CHEEK TO CHEEK: The Songs of Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers, a SNEEK PEEK of their acclaimed show as performed at 54 Below in New York and Le Crazy Coqs in the West End, with Jesse Bielenberg on bass, Directed by Walter Willison.

Her first paid musical engagement was with his band on Clark Terry's 75th birthday; she was 10 years old.

We thrive on challenges, and we stay curious about what we're capable of.\n\nDiversity\n12Petals is global and cross-disciplinary. Our mentors are not only from the classical music scene but also folk, jazz, film, production, marketing, management, administrative industries and many more. We cultivate an environment for our mentors and mentees to discover entirely new life pathways.\n\nAdaptability\nThe world is changing faster than ever. In a harshly competitive global environment, the ability to change and maintain effectiveness and relevance can determine the quality of life. At 12Petals we respect the classics, but we accept that times change and that new ways may need to be embraced. \n\nOur Personal Stories\nMusicianship can be brutal. We've all struggled with the decisions on giving up, persevering, or pivoting. At 12Petals we encourage the refining of our stories. We believe in allowing ourselves to see where we've built physical, mental, emotional, and social resilience through our hardships.\n\nABOUT US:\n12Petals is a community dedicated to accelerating the growth and nourishing the well-being of aspiring and professional young individuals in the music, arts, and education industries. We believe in building meaningful connections and creating more global opportunities by empowering and uplifting others, as well as looking at music, education and life from different lenses.\n\nWe do this by connecting professionals with mentees through workshops, panel discussions, direct mentorship, and more. Through these programs, we strive both to bring clearer awareness to the common pitfalls of our craft and to purify our awareness of its true value.", "view_count": 40, "channel_title": "12Petals", "channel_description": "12Petals is a global and multi-disciplinary mentorship program. \n\nOur Mission\nA healthier ecosystem that empowers and uplifts others through music and education.\n12Petals believes that empowering mentors and mentees who seek to improve the lives of the people around them through music and education is the best way to create more opportunities globally.\n\nOur Core Values\nThe Growth Mindset\nDiversity\nAdaptability\nOur Personal Stories\n\nOur Community Practices\nTogether,\nWe are empathetic.\nWe value process, not product.\nWe honor the vulnerabilities of others.\nWe are accountable for our own actions.\nWe can make space for others even if we disagree.\nWe treat others with respect and open-mindedness.\nWe acknowledge imperfections and are curious for growth.\nTime is our biggest asset- we show up and if we can\u2019t, we let others know early.\n\nFollow us\n\ud83c\udf10https://www.weare12petals.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/weare12petals/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/weare12Petals\n\ud83d\udce7 hello@weare12petals.com\n", "duration": {"duration": "2:19", "duration_in_seconds": 139}}], "biography": "Brandon Lee is a talented trumpet player and bandleader who leads the Brandon Lee Quintet.
